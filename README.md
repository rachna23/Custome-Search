# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: ruby 2.3.3

* Rails version: 5.1.4

* Database: Mysql

* Steps for running the project
1. Run: bundle install
2. Run: rake db:create
3. Run: rake db:migrate
4. Run: rake db:seed
5. Start rails server
6. For running test cases you can run bundle exec rspec

* Click on the image once the server is running. You will get the category list, select category. You will get top 5 images related to that category and color.

* The user could select multiple images and multiple categories, but currently I am using one image and one category selection.
